# Global settings

A few settings in Gunbot work on a higher level, and are not part of any strategy or pair settings. These are called Global settings and affect every trading pair.

Find these settings on the [global settings page](http://localhost:5000/globalsettings)

![Global settings are available under the wheels icon](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2838%29.png)
